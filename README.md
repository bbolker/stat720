This course exposes students to modern ideas in statistical modelling. These include topics such as the general linear
model, penalized regression and the LASSO, random effects and mixed models, generalized linear models, generalized
linear mixed models, and generalized additive models.

Assignments (30%), Midterm (30%), Final Exam (40%). Neither a tutorial nor a lab is needed.

## Expected background/prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites for the course, but as this is a 700-level (advanced graduate) course I will be expecting you to know:

- basics of linear models (as in [STATS 3A03](https://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=53&coid=266607))
- basics of generalized linear models (as in [STATS 4C03/6C03](https://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=53&coid=266618)), including knowledge of exponential family distributions
- inferential statistics: sampling distributions, Central Limit theorem, hypothesis testing, Wald tests, maximum likelihood estimation
- ideally, *basic* knowledge of Bayesian statistics and Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation
- intermediate knowledge of R

If your knowledge of a few of these areas is shaky or missing that's probably OK, but you should be comfortable with most of them.
