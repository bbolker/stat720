I haven't found one book that covers everything in this course exactly the way I would like. Here is a selection of books that I like.

## Primary references

## Peripheral references

* Books by Alain Zuur *et al.* are basic books oriented toward ecology; handle spatial/temporal structure with INLA, 'exotic' conditional distributions (zero-inflation etc.)
* Statistical learning: Witten *et al.* *Introduction to Statistical Learning*, Hastie *et al.* *Elements of Statistical Learning*
* Gelman *et al.* *Bayesian Data Analysis* 3d ed. (complete and technical)
