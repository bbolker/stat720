## Basics

* assume $\y \sim \textrm{Normal}(\X \bbeta, \sigma)$^[Notation-abuse warning ...]
* $\X$ is the *model matrix*, can be anything we want it to be
* the *Gauss-Markov theorem* ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Markov_theorem)) makes weaker assumptions: $\y = \X \bbeta + \beps$; as long as $\beps$ is mean-zero, homoscedastic with finite variance, and uncorrelated ... then the OLS solution
$$
\hat{\bbeta} = (\t{\X} \X)^{-1} \t{\X} \y
$$
is the BLUE (or MVUE).
* we'll embrace the assumptions (which are needed for inference!)

## Model matrices

* everything has to be converted to $\X$ before we start
   * transformations
   * encoding of categorical variables: **contrasts**
   * interactions
   * basis expansions (e.g. polynomials)

## Wilkinson-Rogers formulas [@wilkinsonSymbolic1973a]

- operators: `+`, `*`, `:`, `/`, `-`, `^`
- `I()`

## Contrasts

## Computation

* matrix decompositions (QR with pivoting)
* big problems: `biglm`, `speedglm`, `RcppEigen::fastLm`
   * optimized BLAS, kernel trick, etc.
   * memory vs speed vs robustness ...
   * $p$ vs. $n$ vs. many-small-regressions vs. ...
