# Basics

## Logistics

* (almost) everything at course web page, https://bbolker.github.io/stat720
* communication/forums ([Piazza](https://piazza.com/mcmaster.ca/fall2023/stats720))
* assignment marks (Avenue)
* Zoom/recordings (by request)

## Integrity

* [notes on honesty](../honesty.html)
* why copying code is good
* Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, and all that
* group work

## Prerequisites

From the course outline:

- basics of linear models (as in [STATS 3A03](https://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=53&coid=266607)), with associated linear algebra
- basics of generalized linear models (as in [STATS 4C03/6C03](https://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=53&coid=266618)), including knowledge of exponential family distributions
- inferential statistics: sampling distributions, Central Limit theorem, hypothesis testing, Wald tests, maximum likelihood estimation
- ideally, *basic* knowledge of Bayesian statistics and Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation
- intermediate knowledge of R

# Goals

* principles/practices of statistical modeling
    * choosing a model
	* diagnostics and troubleshooting
* good intermediate understanding of the tools (ridge/lasso, (G)(LA)MMs; unifying principles
* awareness of computational foundations/scaling

## Technical skills & tools

Not focal, but unavoidable and useful

* R (base + some [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/))
* reproducibility
   * version control (Git/GitHub)
   * documents: Quarto/Sweave/Jupyter notebooks

## about me

* weird background (physics/math u/g, Zoology PhD, epidemiological modeling)
* math biology (ecology/evolution/epidemiology)
* computational statistics (mixed models, Bayesian stats)

## things I like/obsess about

* scientific inference $\gg$ pure prediction (but see @navarroScience2019)
* generative models
* data visualization
* solving problems in context, practical issues
* bad statistical practice (p-value abuse, snooping, dichotomania, imbalance handling, ...)

# The modeling cycle

## An iterative process ...

```{r tidyfig, echo = FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "original from [Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/08/teach-tidyverse-23/)"
knitr::include_graphics("pix/tidyverse_model.png")
```

```{r boxfig, echo = FALSE}
#| out-width: 7in
#| fig-cap: "From @boxScience1976b"
#| fig-scap: "Box"
knitr::include_graphics("pix/box_cycle.png")
```

\  <!-- hack for spacing -->

```{r MNfig, echo = FALSE}
#| out-width: 7in
#| fig-cap: "From @mccullaghGeneralized1989 p. 392: 'The introduction of this loop changes profoundly the process of analysis and the reliability of the final models found.'" 
#| fig-scap: "MN"
knitr::include_graphics("pix/MN_cycle.png")
```

## Beware the garden of forking paths!

```{r forking_paths, echo=FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "from [Art Share LA](https://artsharela.org/event/carillon-quartet-the-garden-of-forking-paths/)"
knitr::include_graphics("pix/forking_paths.jpg")
```
* "researcher degrees of freedom", "HARKing", etc.
* @simmons_false-positive_2011; @gelman_statistical_2014

## Solutions?

* pre-registration (formal or informal); report deviations from planned analysis
* choose model complexity (see @harrellRegression2015 ch. 3), do diagnostics etc., **without reference to response variable** or metrics of significance
