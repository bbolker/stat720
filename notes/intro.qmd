# Basics

## Logistics

* (almost) everything at course web page, https://bbolker.github.io/stat720
* communication/forums ([Piazza](https://piazza.com/mcmaster.ca/fall2023/stats720))
* assignment marks (Avenue)
* Zoom/recordings (by request)

## Integrity

* [notes on honesty](../honesty.html)
* why copying code is good
* Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, and all that
* group work

## Prerequisites

From the course outline:

- basics of linear models (as in [STATS 3A03](https://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=53&coid=266607)), with associated linear algebra
- basics of generalized linear models (as in [STATS 4C03/6C03](https://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=53&coid=266618)), including knowledge of exponential family distributions
- inferential statistics: sampling distributions, Central Limit theorem, hypothesis testing, Wald tests, maximum likelihood estimation
- ideally, *basic* knowledge of Bayesian statistics and Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation
- intermediate knowledge of R

# Goals

* principles/practices of statistical modeling
    * choosing a model
	* diagnostics and troubleshooting
* good intermediate understanding of the tools (ridge/lasso, (G)(LA)MMs; unifying principles
* awareness of computational foundations/scaling

## Technical skills & tools

Not focal, but unavoidable and useful

* R (base + some [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/))
* reproducibility
   * version control (Git/GitHub)
   * documents: Quarto/Sweave/Jupyter notebooks

## about me

* weird background (physics/math u/g, Zoology PhD, epidemiological modeling)
* math biology (ecology/evolution/epidemiology)
* computational statistics (mixed models, Bayesian stats)

## things I like/obsess about

* scientific inference $\gg$ pure prediction (but see @navarroScience2019)
* generative models
* data visualization
* solving problems in context, practical issues
* bad statistical practice (p-value abuse, snooping, dichotomania, imbalance handling, ...)
