## R

Upgrade R to the latest version (4.4.1).

Update all of your installed packages by running `update.packages(ask=FALSE, checkBuilt=TRUE)`

For convenience, you can install a lot of packages we'll use in this class by running the code [here](https://github.com/bbolker/stats720/blob/main/code/install_pkgs.R).

## other

See [software notes](software.html) to get other tools (Quarto, TeX, etc.) installed.
