title: "homework 2"

**Due:** Weds ... 11:59 PM. The ideal format for submission is an Rmarkdown or Quarto file, but you can submit it as a Jupyter notebook or as a code file with comments if you prefer. Push your submission to your github repository and send me a note on Piazza to let me know you've done it. You can use R or Python (although the instructions below are R-centric); if you want to use any other language, please check with me first.

**Please make sure your code is reproducible**:

* no absolute path names (e.g. `"C:\My Files\homework"`)
* include any `library()` statements at the top of your file (do not include `install.packages()` statements unless they are commented out)
* make sure I have access to any data files you use in your examples

See also the [R style guide](https://bbolker.github.io/stats720/R_style.html).

If your code isn't reproducible I will return it immediately and ask you to fix it.
